### MindSafe Scores & Kids’ Mental Health

Why these factors matter and how to read them

---

### Overall Developmental Score (0–100)

- **What it is**: A weighted combination of all the dimension scores (pacing, story, language, SEL, fantasy, interactivity).
- **Why it matters**:
  - Gives a **single snapshot** of how developmentally healthy the video is for a given age.
  - Higher scores mean the content is more likely to support learning, emotional growth, and attention in a healthy way.
- **How to read it**:
  - **80–100**: Very strong – consistently positive developmental environment.
  - **60–80**: Generally good – some areas to watch, but overall supportive.
  - **40–60**: Mixed – plenty of good, but some aspects may be confusing or unhelpful.
  - **0–40**: Low – more likely to be noisy, chaotic, or emotionally unhelpful for young kids.

### Brainrot Index (0–100)

- **What it is**: A risk score that mirrors the developmental score but in the opposite direction: **low is good**, high means more risk.
- **Why it matters**:
  - Captures content that may be **overstimulating, attention-fragmenting, or emotionally draining**, even if it isn’t obviously “bad.”
  - High brainrot scores often come from:
    - Extremely rapid cutting or chaotic visuals.
    - Shouting, constant action, or “hyper” tone.
    - Repetitive, shallow content that encourages passive, “zoned‑out” viewing.
- **How to read it**:
  - **0–20**: **Very low risk** – content is unlikely to overload or dysregulate most kids.
  - **20–40**: Low–moderate risk – usually fine, but watch frequency and context.
  - **40–60**: Noticeable risk – kids may come away more wound‑up than when they started.
  - **60–100**: High risk – likely to contribute to “fried” attention and poor self‑regulation over time.

### Pacing

- **What it measures**:
  - **Cuts per minute** and **average shot length** (how often the image changes).
  - Sometimes combined with motion and loudness.
- **Why it matters** for mental health:
  - Very fast pacing trains the brain to expect **constant novelty**, making slow, real‑life activities (homework, conversation, play) feel boring.
  - Extremely rapid visual changes can be **overstimulating for younger brains** and make it hard to self‑soothe after screen time.
- **How to read it**:
  - **High pacing score (~70–90)**: Well‑modulated energy; quick enough to hold attention, not so fast it’s frenetic.
  - **Low pacing score**: Either too chaotic (hyperfast for the age) or monotonous (flat in an unengaging way).

### Story (Narrative Coherence)

- **What it measures**:
  - How well the **events connect**: beginning → middle → end.
  - Whether the video **follows a clear arc** rather than random, disjointed scenes.
- **Why it matters**:
  - A coherent story **supports language development, memory, and cause‑and‑effect thinking**.
  - Random, jumpy content can make it hard for kids to follow what’s happening, increasing mental “noise” without deep understanding.
- **How to read it**:
  - **High story score (e.g. 100/100)**: Clear, easy‑to‑follow narrative; ideal for preschool and early elementary.
  - **Low story score**: Fragmented, skit‑like, or constantly switching topics without resolution.

---

### Language

- **What it measures**:
  - Vocabulary diversity, average utterance length, question rates, and sometimes the presence of **emotion and thinking words** (“feel,” “think,” “wonder,” etc.).
- **Why it matters**:
  - Kids’ language skills grow fastest when they hear **rich, varied, and slightly challenging language**.
  - Very simplistic, repetitive dialogue limits exposure to new words or complex sentences.
  - Content with lots of commands or yelling (and few real conversations) can model poor communication.
- **How to read it**:
  - **Higher language score**: Good mix of words and sentence structures, some new vocabulary, conversational tone.
  - **Lower language score**: Mostly catchphrases, sound effects, and short, simple lines; okay occasionally, but not ideal as the main diet.

### Social‑Emotional Learning (SEL)

- **What it measures**:
  - How often the video:
    - Names **feelings** (“sad,” “frustrated,” “excited”).
    - Shows **healthy coping strategies** (breathing, talking it out, apologizing).
    - Models **empathy, sharing, cooperation, and repair** after conflict.
- **Why it matters**:
  - Young children learn how to handle feelings by watching others:
    - Videos that show **calm problem‑solving** boost emotional vocabulary and regulation.
    - Content that only shows conflict or big emotions (without resolution) can be confusing or anxiety‑provoking.
- **How to read it**:
  - **High SEL score**: Video frequently demonstrates and names healthy emotional strategies.
  - **Low SEL score**: Emotions appear but aren’t handled or explained; may still be okay, just not teaching much in this area.

> If SEL shows as “N/A”, it means the analysis couldn’t reliably classify prosocial/SEL content for that video – results should be interpreted with more caution.

### Fantasy Balance

- **What it measures**:
  - The **level and type of fantasy**: magical elements, imaginary worlds, impossible events.
- **Why it matters**:
  - Fantasy is healthy and important for imagination, but:
    - For very young children, too much **fast or confusing fantasy** (with no grounding in reality) can blur what’s real vs pretend.
    - Healthy fantasy tends to be **coherent and gentle**, not frightening or chaotic.
- **How to read it**:
  - **High fantasy score**: Imaginative but coherent; magical elements support play and curiosity without being overwhelming.
  - **Medium/low fantasy score**: Either very realistic content or fantasy that may be confusing/intense for the age group.

---

### Interactivity

- **What it measures**:
  - How often the video **speaks directly to the child**:
    - Asks questions (“Can you count with me?”).
    - Leaves pauses for answers.
    - Invites movement or participation.
- **Why it matters**:
  - Real learning is **active**, not passive:
    - Videos that treat the child as a participant can better support attention, language, and self‑confidence.
    - Low interactivity isn’t always bad, but a steady diet of purely passive viewing can encourage zoning out.
- **How to read it**:
  - **High interactivity score**: Lots of direct address and genuine invitations to think, move, or respond.
  - **0/100** (like in many music videos) means the video is **purely passive** – still can be fine, but not building interactive habits.

### How to use these scores as a parent or caregiver

- **Look at the overall developmental score first** for a quick “is this generally supportive?” answer.
- **Glance at the brainrot index** to catch content that might be subtly overstimulating even if it looks cute or harmless.
- **Use the dimension scores to make tradeoffs**:
  - A musical video might have:
    - Great pacing and fantasy, but low interactivity → good for occasional viewing, but not the only thing kids watch.
  - A quiet, story‑rich show might:
    - Have slower pacing but high story and SEL → excellent for winding down and learning conversations.
- **Match to your child’s age and temperament**:
  - Sensitive kids may need lower pacing and brainrot.
  - Kids working on language or emotion regulation benefit more from high language and SEL scores.

The goal of MindSafe is not to scare you away from screens, but to **make invisible factors visible** so you can quickly answer:  
“Is this helping or hurting my child’s mental and emotional world right now?”
