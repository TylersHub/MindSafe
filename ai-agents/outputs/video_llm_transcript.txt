The ambient lighting suggests it's evening, casting a warm glow over the room filled with plush toys and a small electronic keyboard. The boy, with a resolute face, exclaims, "Sorry! Not gonna happen! I'm never gonna sleep and you can't make me!" He defiantly points his finger upward, emphasizing his resolve.

His sister, sitting on her bed with a knowing smile, responds, "You wanna bet?" She reaches over to her nightstand, pulling out an object from a drawer. It’s a small, adorable turtle device. "Daddy Turtle Sleep Machine! It's worked since you were a baby," she teases, holding up the turtle as it casts shimmering stars on the ceiling. The boy's bravado falters, and he reacts, "No, no, no! It's too powerful! You can't!"

The dialogue continues as the sister playfully insists, "Yes..." and switches on the device. The boy covers his eyes, overwhelmed by the nostalgic power of the turtle. "Oh, no, no, no, no, no!" he cries, as his sister giggles, clearly enjoying the moment.

[SCENE: A cozy bedroom at night, filled with playful energy and soft, warm lighting from a bedside lamp. Toys are scattered across the wooden floor, suggesting lively activity.]

In the first frame, a young girl and boy are in the midst of a playful scuttle on the bedroom floor. The girl is leaning over, seemingly urging the boy forward. There's a mix of determination and excitement in her movements as she strives “to get to the Sandman,” as she enthusiastically exclaims, "I don't wanna go back!"

The boy, filled with energetic fervor, leaps through the air, chasing a small toy held by the girl. The room around them is decorated with colorful posters and pinned artworks, adding to the vibrant atmosphere. As he soars, he jubilantly declares, "Yes! Sleep, I have vanquished you!" His energy is palpable as he triumphantly tackles the imaginary foe of sleep.

As the action slows, they collapse in a heap of playful exhaustion. The girl sighs contently as she reaches for a nearby turtle-shaped toy, pressing its button decisively. It begins to glow softly, and she offers to make coffee, asking, "Oh, hey Dad. I'm gonna make some coffee. You want some?" Her voice is light and affectionate, trying to extend the cheer to her sleepy-eyed father at the door.

The father watches with a bemused smile as the children lie sprawled on the floor, their laughter slowly subsiding. The girl's final words, “Oh, no. It's Stevie. Stevie will say, why do you have to be so...” hint at an inside joke, fostering a sense of camaraderie and closeness in the room.
