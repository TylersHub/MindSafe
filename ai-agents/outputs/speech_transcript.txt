Sorry! Not gonna happen! I'm never gonna sleep and you can't make me! You wanna bet? Daddy Turtle Sleep Machine! It's worked since you were a baby. No, no, no! It's too powerful! You can't! Yes... Oh, no, no, no, no, no! I... Stevie! Can. No! Elliot! We have to get to the Sandman! I don't wanna go back! Yes! Sleep, I have vanquished you! Oh, hey Dad. I'm gonna make some coffee. You want some? Sigh. Grrr. Oh, no. It's Stevie. Stevie will say, why do you have to be so... Okay, we're done here. Why do you have to be so annoying? Ta-da! Still annoying. Well, thank you. Can I help? No, no. It's okay. This has to be perfect. Come on! Dad taught me to cook French toast, too. I can flip them. Give it back. You're gonna ruin it. Oh! Ah! Give it back! Oh, no! No! Ah! Not my fault. Elliot! Ah! Q! Elliot! Oh, my God. This is just so gross. Could you not leave a trail of rancid meat festering on the floor? How else is baloney Tony gonna find his way home? He's a stuffed animal! Hey, where's Elliot? Oh, I don't know. Where could he be? It's like he just... Disappeared! Ha-ha! Elliot the Extraordinary strikes again! Ugh, Elliot. Hey, Phoebe! You're supposed to help me find a book for my book report. Oh, yeah, because there's nothing more important than that. It's cool. I've got a solid C in that class anyway. Ahh! Elliot, you can't bring home a C. I can if I apply myself. Ugh, okay. Which book do you want to do? This one! Where did you get that? Sleight of hand. You stole... You stole it? Are you crazy? The tag said it was priceless. That obviously means it's free. Duh. This thing is like a rocket! A rocket would be very cool. No, it wouldn't. Wait, what's that? It would probably be irresponsible for me to push this. Elliot, don't! -♪♪♪ -♪♪♪ Oh, enough! Elliot! Sorry, what? If we hold hands and think the same thing at the same time, we can lose this dream! Oh, man! I'm coming for you, Sandman! If you can dream it, you can do it, Stevie! Yeah! I can do it! Ooh! What up, weirdo? Oh... No, no, no, no! Why are you here? I don't know. I fell asleep, and here I am. I... Uh, uh, down, down. Elliot! Put that thing away from me! Don't worry! I trained her. Shake it out. Sit. Shake. Play bed! Ta-da! Wow! Now go away. Hey, how'd you get stuck back here? Someone stuck me back here! in the real world. Hmm. Joanne, your sister, she's standing right there. Okay, back you go. Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! It was you! Yes, it was me. And I'd do it again because he smells like a dumpster fire full of bad meat. Ah, stop. Go on. Or, it's magic! I can see your crack, Houdini. Elliot, you know what it's time for? Ah! Catapult! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Huh? Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! 안녕하십니까 어떡 organs
