CHILD 1: "Sorry! Not gonna happen! I'm never gonna sleep and you can't make me!"

CHILD 2: "You wanna bet? Daddy Turtle Sleep Machine! It's worked since you were a baby."

CHILD 1: "No, no, no! It's too powerful! You can't!"

CHILD 2: "Yes..."

CHILD 1: "Oh, no, no, no, no, no! I..."

CHILD 2: "Stevie!"

CHILD 1: "Can."

CHILD 2: "No!"

CHILD 1: "Elliot! We have to get to the Sandman!"

CHILD 2: "I don't wanna go back! Yes! Sleep, I have vanquished you!"

CHILD 1: "Oh, hey Dad. I'm gonna make some coffee. You want some?"

DAD: "Sigh. Grrr."

CHILD 2: "Oh, no. It's Stevie."

CHILD 1: "Stevie will say, why do you have to be so... Okay, we're done here."

CHILD 2: "Why do you have to be so annoying? Ta-da!"

CHILD 1: "Still annoying."

CHILD 2: "Well, thank you. Can I help?"

CHILD 1: "No, no. It's okay. This has to be perfect."

CHILD 2: "Come on! Dad taught me to cook French toast, too. I can flip them."

CHILD 1: "Give it back. You're gonna ruin it."

CHILD 2: "Oh! Ah! Give it back!"

CHILD 1: "Oh, no! No! Ah!"

CHILD 2: "Not my fault."

CHILD 1: "Elliot! Ah! Q! Elliot!"

CHILD 3: "Oh, my God. This is just so gross."

CHILD 2: "Could you not leave a trail of rancid meat festering on the floor?"

CHILD 3: "How else is baloney Tony gonna find his way home?"

CHILD 2: "He's a stuffed animal!"

CHILD 3: "Hey, where's Elliot?"

CHILD 2: "Oh, I don't know. Where could he be? It's like he just... Disappeared!"

CHILD 1: "Ha-ha! Elliot the Extraordinary strikes again!"

CHILD 3: "Ugh, Elliot."

CHILD 4: "Hey, Phoebe! You're supposed to help me find a book for my book report."

PHOEBE: "Oh, yeah, because there's nothing more important than that."

CHILD 4: "It's cool. I've got a solid C in that class anyway."

PHOEBE: "Ahh! Elliot, you can't bring home a C."

CHILD 4: "I can if I apply myself."

PHOEBE: "Ugh, okay. Which book do you want to do?"

CHILD 4: "This one!"

PHOEBE: "Where did you get that?"

CHILD 4: "Sleight of hand."

PHOEBE: "You stole... You stole it? Are you crazy? The tag said it was priceless."

CHILD 4: "That obviously means it's free. Duh. This thing is like a rocket!"

PHOEBE: "A rocket would be very cool."

CHILD 4: "No, it wouldn't. Wait, what's that?"

PHOEBE: "It would probably be irresponsible for me to push this."

CHILD 4: "Elliot, don't!"

CHILD 2: "Oh, enough! Elliot!"

CHILD 4: "Sorry, what?"

PHOEBE: "If we hold hands and think the same thing at the same time, we can lose this dream!"

CHILD 4: "Oh, man! I'm coming for you, Sandman!"

PHOEBE: "If you can dream it, you can do it, Stevie!"

STEVIE: "Yeah! I can do it!"

CHILD 5: "Ooh! What up, weirdo?"

STEVIE: "Oh... No, no, no, no! Why are you here?"

CHILD 5: "I don't know. I fell asleep, and here I am. I..."

STEVIE: "Uh, uh, down, down. Elliot! Put that thing away from me!"

CHILD 5: "Don't worry! I trained her. Shake it out. Sit. Shake. Play bed! Ta-da!"

STEVIE: "Wow! Now go away."

CHILD 5: "Hey, how'd you get stuck back here?"

STEVIE: "Someone stuck me back here! In the real world."

CHILD 5: "Hmm. Joanne, your sister, she's standing right there."

STEVIE: "Okay, back you go."

CHILD 5: "Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! It was you!"

JOANNE: "Yes, it was me. And I'd do it again because he smells like a dumpster fire full of bad meat."

STEVIE: "Ah, stop. Go on."

JOANNE: "Or, it's magic!"

STEVIE: "I can see your crack, Houdini."

JOANNE: "Elliot, you know what it's time for?"

STEVIE: "Ah! Catapult!"

ALL: "Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!"

STEVIE: "Huh?"

JOANNE: "Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!"
